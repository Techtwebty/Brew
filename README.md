Brew
====

Brew is an open source library of interface components for ASP.NET which utilitizes jQuery and jQuery UI.

If Brew looks familiar, that's for good reason. Brew is a heavily refactored fork of the Juice UI project.

## Current State

If you happen across this repository and poke around in the source, it's important to note that there is unstable development ongoing. The fork is not yet ready for public consumption due to the amount of refactorig taking place and testing yet to be completed.

## Documentation

The demo site for Brew is located at http://shellscape.org/brew. 
A Getting Started guide and documentation for Brew can be found on the [Wiki here on Github](https://github.com/shellscape/brew/wiki).

## Boring Stuff

**Why create Brew?**

I had the pleasure to work on the original Juice UI project (check out the commit history) and while it was a great project, it was always limited in some aspects. Below are the primary reasons I started the fork:

Brew will enjoy a fast and frequent release cycle, whereas Juice UI has a sllloooowwww release cycle. 
Brew isn't bound by a company development schedule or available development resources.
Brew is much leaner than Juice UI.
Brew's extenders and controls are simpler and more intuitive to use. 
Brew doesn't ship with any unnecessary extras.
Brew uses unobtrusive javascript and data attributes. 

**System Requirements**

Brew requires the .NET Framework v4.5. You can download it here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653
There are no plans to include support for earlier versions of .NET, that includes Sharepoint limitations.

**Licensing**

Unless otherwise stated, the code here is licensed under the MIT license. Have at it!
